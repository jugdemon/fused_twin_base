This unity project contains a derivative of a BIM model that was exported to fbx. Furthermore, sensor locations of 390 sensors and 4 gateways have been made available as spheres at the actual location of the sensors in the physical building [[1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9439137/).

This project represents a stand-alone version of the DAVE visualisation of sensor locations in Unity [[1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9439137/). The project has been used for several papers to display a Digital Twin [[1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9439137/) and Fused Twins [[2]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3469410.3469435). Fused Twins display the Digital Twin in situ of the Physical Twin [[3]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07104).

The sensor IDs in the project map to to device IDs in the transmission meta dataset [[4]](https://zenodo.org/record/4476317) and indeed this spatial configuration has been used to determine the walls between sensors and gateways and the distances between units [[1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9439137/).
